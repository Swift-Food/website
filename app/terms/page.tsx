            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Swift Food provides a Platform that allows you to browse, order, and arrange delivery of Items from Swift Partners. We facilitate the processing of your Order, coordinate delivery through Riders, and provide customer support in certain cases.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-4">3.2 Who Prepares Your Order</h3>

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                All Items available on the Platform are prepared and supplied by Swift Partners. We do not manufacture, prepare, or package any food or drink ourselves unless otherwise stated. The contract for the supply of the Items is between you and the relevant Swift Partner. Swift Food is not responsible for the quality, safety, or compliance of the Items provided, except to the extent required by law.

            </div>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              All Riders are responsible for collecting the Items from the Swift Partner and delivering them to the address provided in your Order. We act as an agent on behalf of the Swift Partner for the purpose of arranging delivery.

                Swift Partners are responsible for providing accurate information about the Items they offer, including allergy and dietary information. While we encourage Partners to supply full details, we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. If you have specific dietary or allergy concerns, you must contact the Swift Partner directly before placing your Order.

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You may place an Order through the Platform by selecting Items from a Swift Partner's menu, adding them to your basket, and proceeding through the checkout process. Before confirming your Order, you will be shown a summary of the Items, prices, service fees, delivery charges, and any applicable taxes. You must review this summary carefully before placing your Order.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-4">4.2 When an Order is Confirmed</h3>

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Once you place an Order, we will send you an acknowledgement by email, SMS, or in-app notification. This acknowledgement confirms we have received your Order, not that it has been accepted. Your Order is only accepted when the relevant Swift Partner confirms preparation has started. At that point, a contract for the supply of the Items exists between you and the Swift Partner.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-4">4.3 Cancellations by You</h3>
            <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">• If you believe your Order should be cancelled due to an error or other exceptional circumstances, you must contact us immediately. Refunds in such cases will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
